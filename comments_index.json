It is a tedious process with multiple, time consuming requirements which must be precisely executed within two week from the time their product arrives at your doorstep. One digit was mistakenly inaccurate in the tracting number of my return, which I was required to enter and submit. My return package arrived at their facility and they didn’t bother filing my return, or notify me. The return had my return address clearly legible. Able carry intentionally complicates their return process to thwart returns. Had I not followed up on my return, I am quite certain they would have merely resold my backpack, and not credited me.",
