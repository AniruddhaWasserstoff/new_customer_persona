As entry level jobs become increasingly competitive and fewer in number, young job seekers are struggling to navigate a job market that no longer plays by the same rules. The traditional path of going to college, graduating, and securing a stable first job out of college is being replaced by a maze of confusing application processes, unpaid internships, and automated rejections. For many members of Gen Z, the job search has become more about endurance than opportunity, with outdated systems and unrealistic expectations standing in the way of genuine career development.\n\nGhost jobs, or job listings that companies never intend to fill, continue to flood online platforms, wasting the time and energy of recent graduates who are eager to prove themselves. Platforms like LinkedIn have added another layer of complexity, where algorithmic suppression and a bias toward continuous employment make it even harder for Gen Z to stand out. Crafting a resume, curating a digital profile, and applying to hundreds of jobs has become the new normal—yet meaningful responses are rare. Many are told they lack the right experience, even for jobs labeled as entry level, while others are dismissed for employment gaps or jobs that “don’t align” with their desired career path.\n\nThis isn’t just about Gen Z being young or inexperienced—it’s about the systems in place that no longer support growth. Employers increasingly expect applicants to arrive fully trained, yet invest less and less in job training, mentorship, or on-the-job development. Even unpaid internships, once seen as a stepping stone, have become a luxury not everyone can afford. The gap between those who can afford to work for free and those who need immediate income continues to widen, creating a new kind of economic barrier to entry.\n\nFor many members of Gen Z, the first job out of college feels like an impossible achievement. Even with advanced degrees, certifications, and side projects, many are met with silence. Automated tracking systems filter resumes before a human ever sees them. Cover letters feel obsolete. Phone interviews are replaced with digital assessments. And all the while, Gen Z is told that the job market is strong, despite mounting personal debt, record high housing costs, and stagnant wages that don’t reflect the cost of living.\n\nIn this environment, building a career feels more like surviving a collapse. Networking has turned into unpaid labor. Career advice often feels disconnected from reality. The optimism once tied to starting a new job is now clouded by anxiety, burnout, and doubt. The entry level job, once a rite of passage, now feels like a vanishing illusion—replaced by an endless cycle of unpaid labor, rejection, and confusion. For Gen Z, this isn’t just a job search. It’s a reckoning with a system that promised opportunity and delivered obstruction. The result is a generation forced to adapt in ways no other generation had to—fighting not just for work, but for a future.\n\n#financialeducation #financialfreedom #history \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:23 Why Employers Are NOT Hiring Gen Z\n1:25 How Ghost Jobs Are RUINING The Labor Market\n2:07 How Ghost Jobs Are Plaguing Gen Z In Japan\n3:13 Why Ghost Jobs Are \"Legal\"...

As entry level jobs become increasingly competitive and fewer in number, young job seekers are struggling to navigate a job market that no longer plays by the same rules. The traditional path of going to college, graduating, and securing a stable first job out of college is being replaced by a maze of confusing application processes, unpaid internships, and automated rejections. For many members of Gen Z, the job search has become more about endurance than opportunity, with outdated systems and unrealistic expectations standing in the way of genuine career development.\n\nGhost jobs, or job listings that companies never intend to fill, continue to flood online platforms, wasting the time and energy of recent graduates who are eager to prove themselves. Platforms like LinkedIn have added another layer of complexity, where algorithmic suppression and a bias toward continuous employment make it even harder for Gen Z to stand out. Crafting a resume, curating a digital profile, and applying to hundreds of jobs has become the new normal—yet meaningful responses are rare. Many are told they lack the right experience, even for jobs labeled as entry level, while others are dismissed for employment gaps or jobs that “don’t align” with their desired career path.\n\nThis isn’t just about Gen Z being young or inexperienced—it’s about the systems in place that no longer support growth. Employers increasingly expect applicants to arrive fully trained, yet invest less and less in job training, mentorship, or on-the-job development. Even unpaid internships, once seen as a stepping stone, have become a luxury not everyone can afford. The gap between those who can afford to work for free and those who need immediate income continues to widen, creating a new kind of economic barrier to entry.\n\nFor many members of Gen Z, the first job out of college feels like an impossible achievement. Even with advanced degrees, certifications, and side projects, many are met with silence. Automated tracking systems filter resumes before a human ever sees them. Cover letters feel obsolete. Phone interviews are replaced with digital assessments. And all the while, Gen Z is told that the job market is strong, despite mounting personal debt, record high housing costs, and stagnant wages that don’t reflect the cost of living.\n\nIn this environment, building a career feels more like surviving a collapse. Networking has turned into unpaid labor. Career advice often feels disconnected from reality. The optimism once tied to starting a new job is now clouded by anxiety, burnout, and doubt. The entry level job, once a rite of passage, now feels like a vanishing illusion—replaced by an endless cycle of unpaid labor, rejection, and confusion. For Gen Z, this isn’t just a job search. It’s a reckoning with a system that promised opportunity and delivered obstruction. The result is a generation forced to adapt in ways no other generation had to—fighting not just for work, but for a future.\n\n#financialeducation #financialfreedom #history \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:23 Why Employers Are NOT Hiring Gen Z\n1:25 How Ghost Jobs Are RUINING The Labor Market\n2:07 How Ghost Jobs Are Plaguing Gen Z In Japan\n3:13 Why Ghost Jobs Are \"Legal\"...
